# Save Game System Example

This project provides a basic example of a Save Game system in Unity. It demonstrates how to implement saving and loading functionality for your game. Please note that this example serves as a starting point and should be adapted to fit your own game's specific requirements.

## Getting Started

To use this example, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in Unity Editor.

3. Examine the `Example.cs` script located in the `Scripts` folder. This script contains the main logic for the Save Game system.

4. Replace the placeholder classes (`Game`, `SaveGame`, `GameControl`, `SceneManager`, `LoadingScreen`, etc.) in the `Example.cs` script with the actual implementations from your own game. These classes should handle the game-specific save data, scene management, and other related functionality.

5. Customize the `QuickSave()` and `Load()` methods within the `Example.cs` script to match your game's requirements. These methods are responsible for saving and loading the game state.

6. Adjust the input keys (`KeyCode.F5` and `KeyCode.F9`) used to trigger the save and load actions in the `Update()` method of the `Example.cs` script. Modify them to fit your desired key bindings or input system.

7. Once you have made the necessary modifications and additions to the script, you can test the Save Game system in your game by running it in the Unity Editor or by building and running the game on your target platform.
